- 👋 Hi, I’m Wangare,a Software engineering student at ALX School.
- 👀 I’m  particularly interested in Javascript frameworks.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying low-level programming, high-level programming, system engineering and devops, and web stack programming (Front-end & Back-end) using a methodology based on peer-learning and projects.
- 💞️ I'm curious, adaptable, a fast learner and I love developing my skills.
